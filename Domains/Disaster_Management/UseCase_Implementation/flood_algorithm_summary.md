### **Core Process**:
```
Environmental Data → ML Prediction → Risk Assessment → LLM Analysis → Emergency Response Plan
```

---

## ⚙️ **How the Code Works**

### **Step 1: Environmental Data Collection**
```python
# Simulates comprehensive multi-sensor data collection
environmental_data = {
    "weather": {rainfall, humidity, temperature, pressure},
    "seismic": {earthquake_magnitude, depth, activity_level},
    "wind": {surface_speed, sea_speed, direction, gusts},
    "water_level": {current_level, 24h_change, flood_stage_ratio},
    "rainfall": {local_rainfall, upstream_rainfall},
    "topography": {elevation, population_density, infrastructure}
}
```

**What it does**: Generates realistic environmental data for 6 regions with different flood vulnerabilities.

### **Step 2: Feature Aggregation & ML Prediction**
```python
# Algorithm Steps 1-2: Aggregate features and predict severity
severity_score = weighted_calculation(
    rainfall_factor * 0.4 +           # Heavy rainfall impact
    water_level_factor * 0.3 +        # Water level changes
    upstream_factor * 0.15 +          # Upstream rainfall influence
    wind_factor * 0.1 +               # Wind contribution
    elevation_vulnerability           # Geographic vulnerability
)
```

**What it does**: Combines multiple environmental factors into a single flood severity score (λ ∈ [0,1]).

### **Step 3: Risk Level Classification**
```python
# Algorithm Step 3: Map severity to qualitative risk
if severity >= 0.8: risk = "Critical"      # Immediate evacuation
elif severity >= 0.6: risk = "Severe"      # Urgent action required  
elif severity >= 0.3: risk = "Moderate"    # Enhanced preparedness
else: risk = "Low"                          # Routine monitoring
```

**What it does**: Converts numerical severity into actionable risk levels with specific response protocols.

### **Step 4: LLM Prompt Construction**
```python
# Algorithm Step 4: Create structured disaster management prompt
prompt = f"""
You are an expert disaster management coordinator.

FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Overall Severity: {severity:.3f}
- Risk Level: {risk_level}
- High-risk regions: {high_risk_regions}
- Environmental conditions: {detailed_data}

Provide comprehensive disaster response planning with:
1. Immediate actions and timelines
2. Evacuation procedures and priorities  
3. Emergency alerts and public communication
4. Multi-agency coordination protocols
5. Resource allocation requirements
"""
```

**What it does**: Formats all environmental and risk data into expert-level disaster management consultation.

### **Step 5: AI-Powered Response Generation**
```python
# Algorithm Step 5: Generate comprehensive emergency response plan
response_plan = llm.generate_response(prompt)
# Returns: Detailed evacuation plans, alert wording, authority coordination
```

**What it does**: Produces professional-grade emergency response plans with specific actions, timelines, and responsibilities.
