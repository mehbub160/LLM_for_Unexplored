# 🫐 Blueberry Harvest Planning Pipeline
## Complete AI-Powered Agricultural Decision Support System

---

## 📋 **Overview**

This pipeline transforms raw field images into actionable harvest planning recommendations using computer vision, time-series analysis, and artificial intelligence. It helps blueberry farmers optimize their harvest operations by providing data-driven insights about crop ripeness, workforce planning, and waste management.

## 🎯 **What Problem Does This Solve?**

### **Traditional Harvest Planning Challenges:**
- **Manual Assessment**: Farmers walk fields and estimate ripeness visually
- **Subjective Decisions**: Different people see different ripeness levels
- **Limited Data**: No historical tracking or trend analysis
- **Reactive Planning**: Decisions made after problems occur
- **Waste**: Overripe berries lost due to poor timing

### **Our Solution:**
- **Objective Analysis**: Computer vision provides consistent ripeness assessment
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Historical trends inform future planning
- **Predictive Planning**: Forecast tomorrow's conditions
- **AI Recommendations**: Expert-level advice for every situation
- **Waste Reduction**: Optimize harvest timing to minimize losses

## 🔬 **Technical Deep Dive**

### **Stage 1: Computer Vision Analysis**

```python
Input: Field images (JPG/PNG)
Process: 
- Segmentation (isolate berries)
- Detection (identify individual berries)
- Classification (categorize ripeness)
- Aggregation (field-level statistics)

Output: Ripeness distribution [R1%, R2%, R3%, R4%, R5%]
```

**Ripeness Categories:**
- **R1 (Unripe)**: Green berries, 7-14 days to harvest
- **R2 (Early)**: Pink berries, 3-5 days to harvest
- **R3 (Developing)**: Light blue berries, 1-2 days to harvest
- **R4 (Ready)**: Deep blue berries, harvest immediately
- **R5 (Overripe)**: Dark blue/purple berries, quality degrading

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "analysis_date": "2024-07-04",
  "ripeness_distribution": [12.5, 23.0, 34.5, 26.5, 3.5],
  "images_processed": 67,
  "total_berries_detected": 24356,
  "confidence_score": 0.91,
  "field_coverage": "92%"
}
```

### **Stage 2: Time-Series Database**

```sql
CREATE TABLE ripeness_history (
    date TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    r1_percent REAL,    -- Unripe berries
    r2_percent REAL,    -- Early berries
    r3_percent REAL,    -- Developing berries
    r4_percent REAL,    -- Ready berries
    r5_percent REAL,    -- Overripe berries
    confidence_score REAL,
    total_berries INTEGER
);
```

**Purpose:**
- Track ripeness trends over time
- Enable forecasting and pattern recognition
- Provide historical context for decisions
- Support season-to-season learning

### **Stage 3: Forecasting Engine**

```python
def forecast_ripeness(historical_data):
    """Predict tomorrow's ripeness distribution"""
    
    # For each ripeness stage (R1-R5)
    for stage in range(5):
        values = [day[stage] for day in historical_data]
        
        # Calculate trend
        trend = calculate_trend(values)
        
        # Project forward with dampening
        prediction = values[-1] + (trend * dampening_factor)
        
        # Ensure realistic bounds
        forecast[stage] = max(0, min(100, prediction))
    
    # Normalize to 100%
    return normalize_percentages(forecast)
```

**Forecasting Methods:**
- **Linear Trend**: Simple progression based on recent changes
- **Weighted Average**: Recent days have more influence
- **Seasonal Adjustment**: Account for typical ripening patterns
- **Boundary Constraints**: Ensure percentages stay within 0-100%

### **Stage 4: AI Analysis Engine**

```python
def create_expert_prompt(current_data, forecast, farm_config):
    """Generate structured prompt for AI analysis"""
    
    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert agricultural consultant specializing in blueberry harvest planning.
    
    CURRENT FIELD STATUS:
    - Ready to harvest (R4): {current_data[3]}%
    - Overripe risk (R5): {current_data[4]}%
    
    TOMORROW'S FORECAST:
    - Ready to harvest (R4): {forecast[3]}%
    - Overripe risk (R5): {forecast[4]}%
    
    FARM PARAMETERS:
    - Total plants: {farm_config['total_plants']}
    - Available workers: {farm_config['available_workers']}
    - Harvest capacity: {farm_config['harvest_capacity']} lbs/worker/day
    
    Provide specific recommendations for optimal harvest planning.
    """
    
    return prompt
```

**AI Models Used:**
- **Primary**: LLAMA-2 (via Ollama or Hugging Face)
- **Alternatives**: Mistral, Phi, CodeLlama
- **Fallback**: Rule-based expert system

### **Stage 5: Mathematical Calculations**

**Core Algorithm Implementation:**

```python
# Step 4: Manpower Estimation (from original algorithm)
def calculate_workers_needed(forecast, farm_config):
    r4_percentage = forecast[3]  # Ready to harvest
    total_plants = farm_config['total_plants']
    harvest_capacity = farm_config['harvest_capacity']
    
    # Calculate berries ready for harvest
    berries_ready = (r4_percentage / 100) * total_plants * berries_per_plant
    
    # Calculate workers needed
    workers_needed = ceil(berries_ready / harvest_capacity)
    
    return workers_needed

# Step 5: Waste Estimation (from original algorithm)
def calculate_waste(forecast):
    waste_percentage = forecast[4]  # R5 overripe berries
    return waste_percentage
```
