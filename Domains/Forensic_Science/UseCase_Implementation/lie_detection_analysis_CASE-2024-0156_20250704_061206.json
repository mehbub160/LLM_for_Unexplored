Timeline Inconsistencies: Subject's account conflicts with key card access logs\n2. Memory Selectivity: Claims poor memory for incriminating details but clear recall for alibis  \n3. Defensive Language: Overuse of denial phrases and character assertions\n4. Location Confusion: Initial denial of 5th floor access, later admission with hedging\n\n=== RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS ===\nIMMEDIATE:\n• Confront subject with key card evidence showing 5th floor access at 14:37\n• Request detailed written timeline of all activities between 14:00-16:00\n• Verify claimed interactions with supervisor \"Tom\" and maintenance staff\n• Review complete security footage from 5th floor during incident window\n\nINVESTIGATIVE:\n• Check subject's financial records for recent stress indicators\n• Interview supervisor and maintenance staff mentioned as potential alibis\n• Examine subject's work computer for recent activity logs\n• Consider polygraph examination given high deception indicators\n\n=== PROSECUTION CONSIDERATIONS ===\nStrengths:\n• Physical evidence (key card access) contradicts subject statements\n• Multiple deception indicators suggest consciousness of guilt\n• Witness observations support timeline concerns\n\nWeaknesses:\n• Subject has not fully confessed\n• Some memory claims could be attributed to stress\n• Need stronger corroboration of motive\n\n=== CONCLUSION ===\nThe analysis indicates LOW likelihood of deception based on multiple inconsistencies\nbetween the subject's statements and established evidence. The pattern of selective memory,\ndefensive language, and direct contradictions with physical evidence suggests deliberate\ndeception rather than innocent confusion.\n\nRecommendation: Continue investigation with focus on confronting specific contradictions\nand obtaining independent verification of all alibi claims.",
